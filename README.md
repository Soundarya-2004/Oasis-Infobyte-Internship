Welcome to the Java Projects Repository! This repository contains two beginner-to-intermediate level Java applications: **Number Guessing Game** and **ATM Simulation**.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Number Guessing Game
The Number Guessing Game is a simple and interactive program where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides clues to narrow down the range after each guess and awards points based on the number of attempts.

#### Features:
- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- User-friendly clues for narrowing down the guess range.
- Scoring system based on the number of attempts:
  - 5 attempts: 10 points
  - 4 attempts: 20 points
  - 3 attempts: 30 points
  - 2 attempts: 40 points
  - 1 attempt: 50 points
- Option to replay the game after completion.

#### How to Run:
1. Compile the code using any Java compiler (e.g., `javac Task_2.java`).
2. Run the program using `java Task_2`.
3. Follow the prompts to play the game!

### 2. ATM Simulation
The ATM Simulation is a basic command-line application that mimics some functionalities of an ATM. The user can check their balance, deposit money, withdraw funds, and exit the session.

#### Features:
- PIN authentication with up to 3 attempts.
- Options for:
  - Checking balance.
  - Depositing money.
  - Withdrawing money.
- Error handling for invalid amounts and insufficient funds.
- User-friendly menu-driven interface.

#### How to Run:
1. Compile the code using any Java compiler (e.g., `javac ATM.java`).
2. Run the program using `java ATM`.
3. Follow the prompts to interact with the ATM simulation.
